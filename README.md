# Forum Authentication Project
The goal of this project is to implement new ways of authentication. You are able to register and to login using Google and Github authentication tools.

## Objectives

<ul>
    <li>Enable communication between users via posts and comments.</li>
    <li>Allow categorization of posts.</li>
    <li>Support liking and disliking of posts and comments.</li>
    <li>Implement filtering of posts based on categories, created posts, or liked posts.</li>
    <li>Enable sign in or sign up using Google and GitHub accounts.</li>
</ul>

## User Authentication
Users must register and log in to interact with the forum:

<ul>
    <li>Registration requires an email, username and password or Google, GitHub account.</li>
    <li>Returns an error if the email is already taken.</li>
    <li>Login session uses cookies to maintain a single session per user, with a defined expiration.</li>
</ul>

## User Interaction

Post and Comment Creation:
<ul> 
    <li>Registered users can create posts and comments. Posts can be associated with categories. Images can be upload to posts</li>
</ul>

Likes and Dislikes: 
<ul>
    <li>Registered users can like or dislike posts and comments. Totals are visible to all users.</li>
</ul>

## Filtering
A filtering mechanism allows users to filter posts by:

<ul>
    <li>Categories (Autobiography, Comedy, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Mystery, Other).</li>
    <li>Created posts (specific to logged-in users).</li>
    <li>Liked posts (specific to logged-in users).</li>
</ul>
